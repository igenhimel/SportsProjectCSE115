PROFILE:
________
Passionate. No word describes Virat Kohli better. His passion for cricket has made him one of the best 
batsmen in the world across formats, and has also helped him grow into a ruthless captain. It's also 
passion that defines Kohli's emotional, effervescent and at times firecracker character. 
Virat Kohli does not hold back and that remains his strength.
