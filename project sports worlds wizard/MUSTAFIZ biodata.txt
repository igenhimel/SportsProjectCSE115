PROFILE:
________
A nineteen-year-old Mustafizur Rahman grabbed attention during India's tour of Bangladesh (June 2015) 
when he became the second bowler in ODI history after Zimbabwe's Brian Vitori to pick up two five-wicket 
hauls in his first two matches. In fact, he is the only bowler to take a total of 11 wickets in his first 
two games. In his 3rd ODI against India, he took 2 wickets and made history by taking 13 wickets in a 3-match ODI series.
