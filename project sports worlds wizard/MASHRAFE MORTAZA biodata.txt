PROFILE:

Mashrafe's entry also sparked plenty of enthusiasm because he was the first genuine fast bowler to 
emerge from Bangladesh since their entry into Test cricket in 2000. He was sent to a camp conducted 
by West Indian great Andy Roberts, who proclaimed that Mashrafe had a great future. The selectors 
fast-tracked his growth and within a few months, during which he played four games for Bangladesh A 
in India, the young man from far-off Narail took the new-ball against visiting Zimbabwe. Soon it was 
clear that he had what it takes: Mashrafe was making the likes of Grant Flower jump around due to his pace, 
a first for a Bangladeshi fast bowler.
